Notes for Place-specific exercise


Questions for the groups
- Why did you choose the toggles you did? (e.g., Why a low turnout comparison? Why a polarization comparison? Why a candidate pool or candidate strength comparison?) 
	
Possible report elements
- paragraph on the history of the body (structure, plus who’s elected -- pix of electeds if possible), outline of the toggles (study design)
- choropleth of minority groups’ distribution
- overview of how classic PSMD would perform (using districting ensembles), such as with boxplots
- outline of the toggles (study design)
    - Design A:  choose a baseline setting (e.g., MA chooses C70W30, Dirichlet 1, full turnout, m=5, candidate pool proportional) and vary toggles one at a time
    - Design B:  choose a limited number of toggles and do a full expansion (e.g., WA chooses from 4 voter behavior models, 4 kinds of polarization, 5 kinds of candidate strength, 5 m-structures, 2 candidate pools makes 800 possibilities)
- table of outcomes by scenario combo
- figures
    - bubble plot split by voter behavior model (MA, FRA)
    - KDE plots split by polarization category, model (WA)
    - summary ranges (WA)

Goals/deliverables for the end:  
- standard elements:  history of the body, choropleth, outline of toggles
at least two summary plot figures illustrating at least one toggle each
a “what’s next” section
