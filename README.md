## Running with Docker

Docker is a program to help describe and reproduce environments for running applications and analysis. It helps us start up a Python environment on your computer, without the need to manually install and configure Python and data anaylsis modules.

To get started:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Open your terminal, and navigate to this repository (eg. `cd /Users/Me/Documents/Github/Training_Materials`)
3. Run `docker compose up`

Your computer will set up the required programs, libraries, and configuration. This may take a few minutes. You should see a message that says something like "Jupyter Server 2.16.0 is running at...", which indicates the set up was successful.

Now, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) in your web browser and you can use jupyter.

To shut down Docker, you can use the Docker Desktop application or hit Control+C in your terminal.
